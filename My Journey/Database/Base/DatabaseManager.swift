/*
 When an iOS app is uninstalled from a device, all of the files associated with it are deleted (including any Realm files).
 For storing data even the user deletes the app, a good solution is to use a server side.
 
 For example, Firebase could be used to store data for users.
 For data separation, they can either make an "account" with an unique username
 or using a device ID to keep their data apart.
 This would change the database architecture a little, being required replacement of Coorinates inside Journey with uuids.
